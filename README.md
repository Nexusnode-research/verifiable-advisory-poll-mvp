**Abstract (140 words).**  
A lean, publicly auditable advisory-poll MVP using an existing voter roll with one-time codes (OTP), a Public Bulletin Board (PBB) that publishes hashed issuance/spend/receipt records, and a 2-of-3 trustee model. Voters receive a receipt and can verify inclusion; observers reconcile ISSUANCE ≥ SPEND ≥ RECEIPT and verify trustee signatures and roots. Pilot scope: one district, USSD/SMS + web, 99.5% availability during a 48–72h window. A ZAR cost envelope and phased roadmap are included. Reuse under CC BY 4.0.
